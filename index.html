		<h2>Artificial Intelligence, also called "Machine Intelligence", is humanistic characteristics performed by machines.</h2>
		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>The study of mathematical logic lead to the creation of "The Theory of Computation", by Alan Turing. The Theory of Computation suggests that a machine is capable of simulating any act of mathematical deduction by using only 0 and 1.  Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky and Arthur Samuel became the leaders and founders of AI research in 1956, Dartmouth College. They and their students created many complex programs. In 1954, computers were learning to play checkers; five years later, in 1959, they were recorded to be better than the average human. Unfortunately in 1974, the U.S. and the British Government cut off AI research due to pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more "productive" research. Thankfully in 1980, AI research was revived after a long period of difficult funding known as the "AI Winter" due to the commercial success of expert systems. Meanwhile, Japan's project, "The Fifth Generation Computer" had inspired the U.S. and the British governments to restore funding for academic research. However in 1987, AI research fell into disrepute, following the collapse of the Lisp Machine. Later, in the 1990s and the early 21st century, AI was used for a variety of purposes, including medical diagnosis, data mining, and more. A chess computer named "Deep Blue" became the first computer to beat a reigning chess champion, Garry Kaskaprov, on May 11th, 1997. By the mid 2010s, machines were used throughout the world. In a Jeopardy match, IBM's question answering system defeated two of the greatest Jeopardy champions, Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. 2015
